## About the Project

This portfolio website serves as a digital resume and project showcase. It includes a brief introduction about myself, a list of my projects with descriptions and images, and a contact form that allows visitors to reach out to me.

The website is structured using semantic HTML to ensure that the content is well-organized and accessible.

## Features

- **About Me Section**: A brief introduction to who I am, my background, and my interests.
- **Projects Section**: A showcase of my projects, including descriptions and images.
- **Contact Me Page**: A simple contact form for visitors to send me a message directly from the website.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files:
- **`portfolio.html`**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the portfolio, including the About Me and Projects sections.
- **`contact-me.html`**: A separate HTML file dedicated to the Contact Me form.
- **`placeholder.jpg`**: A placeholder image used in the Projects section until real project images are added.
